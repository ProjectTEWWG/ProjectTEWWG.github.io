“Every day after that they managed to meet in the scrub 
oaks across the road and talk about when he would be a
big ruler of things with her reaping the benefits. Janie 
pulled back a long time because he did not represent 
sun-up and pollen and blooming trees, but he spoke for 
far horizon. He spoke for change and chance. Still she 
hung back. The memory of Nanny was still powerful and 
strong” (29).
