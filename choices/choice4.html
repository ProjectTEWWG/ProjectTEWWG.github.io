**Characteristics:** <br>
helpful and revitalizing<br>
<br>
**Greek Myth Interpretation:** <br>
In a myth involving Athena, the writer describes how 
lemons trees were “Happy to be a favorite and useful 
tree for everyone”<br>
<br>
**Book Connection:** <br>
The lemon tree represents Teacake, who becomes apart of 
Janie’s “rebirth” after Jody dies, being a beacon of 
energy for everyone he is surrounded with
<br>
<br>
**Quote:** <br>
“Tea Cake fell in beside her and mounted the porch 
this time. So she offered him a seat and they made a 
lot of laughter out of nothing. Near eleven o’clock 
she remembered a piece of pound cake she had put away. 
Tea Cake went out to the lemon tree at the corner of 
the kitchen and picked some lemons and squeezed them 
for her. So they had lemonade too” (101).
