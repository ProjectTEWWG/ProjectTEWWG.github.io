                <h2>The lemon tree</h2>
                <p>
                    Characteristics: helpful and revitalizing <br>
    Greek Myth interpretation: In a myth involving Athena, the writer describes how lemons trees were “Happy to be a favorite and useful tree for everyone” <br>
    The lemon tree represents Teacake, who becomes apart of Janie’s “rebirth” after Jody dies, being a beacon of energy for everyone he is surrounded with

                <h2>The pear tree</h2>
                <p>
                    Characteristics: motherhood and fertility<br>
                    Greek Myth interpretation: Homer states pears are “Gifts from the gods”<br>
                    The pear tree is unattainable except in Janie’s fantasies, as there is no person who can be a perfect gift from the gods. Additionally, Janie never has kids, further emphasizing how Janie doesn’t achieve her young pear tree vision to “bloom.”
